Thread-local variables for Swift.


## Overview

Use the ``ThreadLocal()`` macro to define a thread-local static variable:
```swift
extension SomeType {
    @ThreadLocal
    private static var counter: Int = 0
}
```
Each thread will have its own version of the variable.
On each thread, the variable is initially initialized to its default value (0 in the example above).
When the thread is destroyed, the variable's lifetime is ended.

You can use non-trivial types with thread-local variables, and can provide a custom deallocator if needed (see ``ThreadLocal(deallocator:)``).

See [the documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/lukaskollmer/ThreadLocal) for more info.
